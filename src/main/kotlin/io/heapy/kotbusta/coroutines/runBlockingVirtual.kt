/**
 * Runs a suspending block of code within the context of a virtual thread and blocks the current virtual thread
 * until the execution of the block is complete.
 *
 * This function must be called from a virtual thread, which is validated via a runtime check.
 * It allows executing suspending code within a synchronous paradigm tailored for use within virtual thread contexts.
 *
 * @param context The coroutine context in which the suspendable block will execute.
 * @param block The suspending lambda function to be executed within the virtual thread context.
 * @return The result of the suspending block once its execution is complete.
 * @throws IllegalStateException If the function is called from a non-virtual thread.
